This is a simple user management app built with **React** that allows users to:

- Log in with predefined credentials.
- View a paginated list of users.
- Search through the list by name or email.

The app uses a mock API from **ReqRes** to simulate fetching, updating, and deleting user data.

2. **View Users**: Displays a paginated list of users fetched from a mock API.
3. **Search Functionality**: Search users by first name, last name, or email.
4. **Edit User Details**: Update user information like name and email.
5. **Delete Users**: Remove users from the list.
6. **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on all devices.
7. **Interactive UI**: Smooth hover transitions on buttons and box shadow effects for an enhanced UI.

## Technologies Used
1. **React** (with hooks)
2. **Axios** for API requests
3. **React Router** for navigation
4. **CSS** for styling (custom and responsive)
